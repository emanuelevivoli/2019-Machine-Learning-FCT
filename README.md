# Introduction
This repo contains codes and documentations for two project of the "Machine Learning" course attended at NOVA Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, in Lisbon.
The course's webpage is at ["Aprendizagem Automatica"](http://aa.ssdi.di.fct.unl.pt/) (Machine Learning).

The projects has been conducted together with [Simone Rossi (@gitgithurrab)](https://github.com/gitgithurrab).

# Structure

The Project is structures as follow:

  - [First](https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/AA_Project/tree/master/First) 

      parametrize, fit and compare **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine** classifiers;
      
      the description of the work is at [First/README.md](https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/2019-Machine-Learning-FCT/tree/master/First/README.md)

  - [Second](https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/AA_Project/tree/master/Second) 

      examine a set of **bacterial cell images** using machine learning techniques, including **feature extraction**, **features selection** and **clustering**, in order to help the biologists organize similar images;
