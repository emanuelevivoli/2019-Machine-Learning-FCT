- Do not edit this file in text editors like Word. Use a plain text editor only. In case of doubt, you can use Spyder as a text editor.
- Do not change the structure of this file. Just fill in your answers in the places provided (After the R#: tag).
- You can add lines in the spaces for your answers but your answers should be brief and straight to the point.
- You can include references to images or html files such as the reports generated with clusters. To do this, simply include this document in the folder with the reports or images and refer them in the text by the file name in an isolated line. For example, the line

test.png

refers to a test.png image file in the same folder as this document.

QUESTIONS:

Q1: Explain how you selected the best attributes for the clustering phase. In particular, indicate the visualization methods used to explore the extracted attributes and any statistical tests used.
R1:

After the standardization, we see at the correlation matrix:

We can see that the first sixt feature represented in the 6x6 square in the top left are very uncorrelated between them, in fact they are the PCA trasformation of the space, and the PCA axis are Linearly independent.
Also the 6x6 square in the bottom rigth represent that the 6 features of the isomap are very uncorrelated. One thing that we notice is that the middle 6 variables are a bit correlated between them, they correspond to the feature from the tne.
Now the important things that guided us to the following steps is that between the first 6 (PCA) features and the last 6 (Isomap) features we have a correlation thet in general il bigger than 0.6.
So the PCA feature represent quite similar information about the data, than Isomap.
Than we remove the feature highly correlated. We can see a scatter maps of this features in the following image:

The last thing that we did is the Anova test twith the H0 hypothesis of equality of the means cector for the different class (in our case, clusters).
With this test we select the p_values of every features (resulting from the univariate test on each feature) and we calculate the critic value.
We than reject the features that satisfies the test, and so that are no informative because the means of the cluster are (for the Anova test) equals with 95% of confident (assuming alpha = 5%).
We end up with 10 features.


Q2: After selecting the attributes, did you standardize or normalize the values? Justify your decision.
R2:


Q3: Explain how you found the neighborhood radius value (epsilon) for the DBSCAN algorithm by following the procedure described in the article "A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise".
R3:


Q4: Examining the clusters generated by the DBSCAN algorithm with the value optimized by the method described in the article, do you think the result is adequate to cluster these images? Justify your answer.
R4:


Q5: Describe your analysis of the k (for K-Means) and epsilon (for DBSCAN) parameters using the internal and external indicators referred in the assignment page. Include the two plots of the indicator values â€‹â€‹(indicating the image name of each plot in one line in your answer) as a function of the k and epsilon parameters and explain how you chose the ranges for examining these parameters. Indicate, with justification, what conclusions you can draw from this analysis.
R5:

Q6: Select some of the parameter values â€‹â€‹tested in question five and examine the corresponding clusters more closely, generating the HTML file with the images. Explain how you selected these parameter values, discuss the different options and propose a recommendation that could help the biologists' task of classifying cells and rejecting segmentation errors.
R6:

Q7: Discuss advantages or problems with these two algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN) for the purpose of helping biologists to organize these images, considering your theoretical knowledge of these algorithms as well as the results you obtained in your work.
R7:

Q8: Consider other clustering algorithms embedded in the Scikit-Learn library. Choose one and apply it to this problem, optimizing the parameters you deem appropriate in the way that you find adequate. Justify your choices and discuss whether this option would yield more useful results for biologists.
R8:

Q9: (Optional) Implement the Bissecting K-Means hierarchical clustering algorithm as described in the assignment page and Lecture 19. Examine and discuss the results and their application to the problem of helping the biologists select and classify cell images.
R9:
